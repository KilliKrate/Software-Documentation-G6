 ### 2 STARTUP PLAN
 #### 2.1 Team Organization
 Team members:
 * Project Leader:         Ovidiu Costin Andrioaia. 
 The project leader is responsible for creating the project plan, managing risks, running the weekly team meeting and providing monthly status reports to senior management.

 * Front-end developer:    Daivd Constantin Cirdan - Zhiang Angelo Xia. 
 The Front-end developers are responsible for choosing the design and style of the application and he is responsabile for coding  the user interface.

 * Back-end developer:     Luciano Mateias. 
 The Back-end developer is responsible for coding
 the part of the application that will manage the data provided by the front-end.

 * Marketing :             Zhiyang Angelo Xia. 
 He deals with the sales policies of a company's products. It establishes the techniques and strategies it must adopt to sell more.
 #### 2.2 Project Communications
 The information is collected in the weekly mitting, in which each sector reports on the data obtained, so as to be able to obtain a graph and check the progress of the project. 
 The data transmission occurs thanks to the use of multiple channels:
 * Social media
 * Github
 * Referral through users
 #### 2.3 Technical Process
 As a development methodology the team chose to use the cascade model together with the UTF-8 standard for the code. with the cascade model the development was divided into sequential phases, in which each phase produces an output which is used as input for the next phase.
 #### 2.4 Tools
 Tools used for development:
 * Programming Language:   Python - JavaScript
 * Version Controll:       Github
 * Defect tracking:        Bugzilla
 * Build tools:            PyCharm
 * Database:               SQL

 ### 4 Control Plan
 #### 4.1 Monitoring and Control
 The following list of dates includes formal reviews of the project and major accomplished milestones
 in reference to the established schedule.
 
 | Date | Review / Milestone |
 | ---- | ------------------ |
 | 04/10/2019 | Project start |
 | 13/05/2019 | Software Documentation and planning completed |
 | 05/17/2019 | Start of the first iteration |
 | 05/30/2019 | Review of the first iteration |
 | 06/01/2019 | Start of the second iteration |
 | 06/17/2019 | Beta release and feedback from stakeholders |
 | 07/20/2019 | Further development of the platform |
 | 09/13/2019 | Application fully downloadable from Github repository | 
 #### 4.2 Configuration Management Plan
 This is the procedure to follow when making changes to the final product:
 1. All the data is stored on a GIT repository hosted by Github, this is the main container.
 2. All the changes to documents and files are tracked via commits and comments
 inside them, including the software documentation.
 3. Changes are verified only after all the development team has seen and approved them.
 4. The change control procedure is the one that follows:
    * send an e-mail to one of the developers, where it is explicitly described the parts of the software to modify,
    how impactful this changes are, the needed resources and time constraints.
    * if the e-mail doesn't receive any response within 30 days, the request will be dispatched, otherwise
    the recipient will contact the applicant and set the application process.
    * the petitioner from now on will be part of the project development and will implement
    the new feature with close collaboration with the team, following all the assigned instructions.
    * after the change has been successfully actualized, all the documentation and schedule will be updated with the new changes,
    as well as the public software.

#### 5.2 Test Plan

The test plan defines the items that will be tested, methods for testing, and a schedule detailing the tasks, owners, and time line.

The test plan will be available in a separate document in the version control system at: https://github.com/KilliKrate/Software-Documentation-G6/blob/master/docs/test%20plan.md

#### 5.3	Product Acceptance Plan

At the completion of each iteration, the prototype will be tested. Testing will be made via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to create an isolated and uncontaminated environment. The software tested on Docker will face multiple checks with different operative systems to ensure the proper behavior.
