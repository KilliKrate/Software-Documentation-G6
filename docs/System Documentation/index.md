## [Introduction](#introduction)

Lezioni alla Pari is an online desktop application designed to streamline knowledge sharing between people inside a closed environment: any group can use our platform to create lessons in the form of illustrated documents or video, in order to instruct their peers on subjects of interest. This document will provide instructions for accessing the application code and installing it into a simulator or compatible device.

Access to the internet and clone the below Git repository to store the used code. The repository is public, therefore it is not necessary to make any access to be able to use the code, but if you want to submit a change you must ask for the permission of the project manager.
