Lezioni alla Pari is an online desktop application designed to streamline knowledge sharing between people inside a closed environment: any group can use our platform to create lessons in the form of illustrated documents or video, in order to instruct their peers on subjects of interest. This document will provide instructions for accessing the application code and installing it into a simulator or compatible device.
