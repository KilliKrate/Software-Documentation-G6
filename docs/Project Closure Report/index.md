### [1. Project Background Overview](#1-project-background-overview)

#### [1.1 Project Overview](#11-project-overview)
The main goal of this project was to develop a platform under the guise of an application from where teachers, students, work groups and many other team-based organizations could share any type of material and coordinate their work between them, whilst maintaining everything local and confidential.\
The project started with the definition of the main goals that needed to be achieved in order to comply to the purpose of the application:
+ Designing the architecture of the various components and documenting the process and procedures
+ Finding partners and stakeholders who are willing to support the project
+ Developing the application with Python and Javascript, providing the back-end and front-end
+ Launching the beta
+ Fixing bugs, receiving feedback, various refinements
+ Final release to the public

### [2. Project Performance and Outcome](#2-project-performance-and-outcome)

#### [2.1 Project Success](#21-project-success)

The project was successful in its premise as our partners have fully adopted our platfrom as a service for their teams and group organizations inside their establishment. In particular, ITI G.Marconi Verona has integrated the application in its schooling network, whereas Università di Verona used the system to make further research inside the education field. Many other independent users and organizations downloaded the project from GitHub.

#### [2.2 Project Outcome, Goal and Objectives](#22-project-outcome-goal-and-objectives)

Most of the intended objectives and outputs where achieved as planned. \
Problems encountered during development where mainly caused by time constraints and a lack of resources and budget, as the deliverables where not delivered accordingly to the planning and no founding was granted upon project start. \
Nevertheless, customers have provided a good feedback and were not taken back from the lengthy development of the application, neither the shortage of means.

#### [2.3 Project Deviations](#23-project-deviations)

The pre-planned milestones and project deliverables had been delayed many times due to time constraints, lengthy research and browsing and sometimes technical issues.\
The scope of the project hasn't been narrowed, on the contrary, it has widened as the development was taking place: for instance, the video streaming feature appeared only after most of the platform had been already designed and built, and this is applicable to many other little features and details that have been implemented into the application, mostly graphical and aesthetical.\
The time constraints pushed the project to develop the essentials at first, that resulted in a bare-bones platform, but which could still be presentable, and only with time and effort evolved into the polished and refined final product. \
A major lack of resources and funds were the main cause of the slow pace of the project, but also the inability to build a high-end, feature rich, extensible and advanced application.

#### [2.4 Models, Methods, Tools and Processes](#24-models-methods-tools-and-processes)

To build the application the following tools have been adopted:
+ Programming Languages: Python - Javascript
+ VCS: GitHub Inc.
+ Defect tracking: Bugzilla
+ IDE: PyCharm
+ Database: SQL

The SCRUM method has been used to organize the work between team members and the project developing steps. Instant messaging apps were made use of in order to keep contact.
