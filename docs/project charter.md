## Stakeholders and Expectations: 

Team: has the authority to make decision for the entire project, incuding resource management, and has to organize and complete tasks based on the other stakeholders needs and partner feedback.

Customers: will use the application to share learning material and leave simple quizzes as homework at the end of each document. Because of the simplicity of the application, students will also use the application as reference for future projects.

The Sponsor: will have an application to enhance the school’s learning experience for its students and professors, while also gaining local visibility since it was made by its students.

## Purpose

Thanks to the creation of an open and non-profit learning platform students and professors alike will be able to streamline knowledge sharing between small groups, classes, or even entire departments, while also making computerized quizzes and tests easier to make. Other insitutions and companies will also be able to use this system for learning materials and resources, especially for interns or new employees.

## Goals and Objectives

The overall goal is to give students and professors alike an easy to use and intuitive platform to share knowledge by creating courses and quizzes. The app is expected to:

- Provide an account login, registration and options section
- Provide a way to create and manage courses and quizzes
- Provide a way to view other people’s courses and complete their tests
- Function in a simple and intuitive manner
- Deliver content efficiently and on-demand

**240 hours total, $9300 total, avg, $38,75 per hour**

## Project Priorities and degrees of freedom

Internal development dates are generally flexible only by a few days at most, and with the authorization of the project manager.  Budget is extendable in terms of hours put in by each team member. The team members amount of weekly hours may change based on the amount of work to be done, as organized by the project manager. Roles are changeable based on workloads of individual team members.  Roles are expected to shift throughout the project as needs arise.

## Approach 

The SCRUM development strategy will be used to its fullest extent, as development will be based on Sprints, after which feedback from the stakeholders will be received and analyzed for subsequent iteration. After the back-end and basic front end has been deployed, a beta phase will start, in which all partners will 

## Constraints

The project will have to be supported by at least 3 partners before the beta phase, in order to have an acceptable amount feedback. The application must satisfy security and privacy standards of public institutions before release. If support after release or partners is not sufficient, the platform will be launched to the public domain as an online learning tool.

## Assumptions: 

 Team members will work from home, since no office space is available. Transition from a desktop client to an online website is possible, and will happen if the project does not meet its success criteria.  

## Success Criteria

At least 3 official insitutions/companies that have successfully adopted our platform will be considered as a success to the project. The platform’s efficiency in the learning process can be measured through an integrated star-based review system. We expect this outcome to be achieved in about 2 years.

## Scope

The software will provide users with the tools necessary for the creation of illustrated text documents and will also enable them to upload video lessons. A Q&A section will be available on each lesson in a forum-like structure. The result of the quizzes will be accessible by the creator of the lesson, who will also be able to review the answers given by each user. The project does not include a file-sharing system, although it could be implemented as part of a post-release update.

## Risks and obstacles to success:  

The project faces a notable risk because of the lack of the team's relevant experience on developing database-based applications. A base monthly financial target has to be achieved in order to keep the project alive. Not reaching the minimum target will result in the failure of the project and the consequential end of support.
